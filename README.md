## Installation:
This software requires PETSc 3.10 or later. The environment variable ```VFDIR``` must point to the root directory of the folder. Upon executing ```make```, a binary ```VPFHF``` should be buiult in ```$VFDIR/bin/$PETSC_ARCH```

## Testing:
Some examples are included in ```$VFDIR/ValidationTests```
